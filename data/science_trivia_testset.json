He was heavily involved in personally field testing equipment that led to the creation of safe ejection seats and oxygen systems in aircraft. He was subjected to over 41.8 Gs on the last test run he did on the Sonic Wind test-sled. He survived because the G-load was applied for only a second or less. Sonic Wind reached 632 miles an hour in 5 seconds on that run before the brakes were applied. Funnily enough,  braking generated the greatest forces on his body -  going from a little over 600 miles an hour to 0 in only 1.4 seconds...."

Tungsten's high melting point has to do with the arrangement of electrons in its d-shell orbitals - they're half filled which is an exceptionally stable state to be in. More stability = harder to change."

    "details": "A material is called piezoelectric (pz) if it accumulates an electric charge when a mechanical stress is applied (i.e. pinching, pushing, bending, twisting, etc). The cool thing is that the opposite is also true - the application of an electric current will cause mechanical deformation. This is actually how simple electric buzzers work! A rapidly pulsing current is passed through a thin pz strip or plate causing the pz material to rapidly flex. These quick vibrations induce other vibrations in the surrounding air - which we then hear as a buzz! The pitch can be changed by altering the length of the current's pulse and by increasing or decreasing the current strength!"
