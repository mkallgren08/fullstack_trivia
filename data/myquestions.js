var quesOne = {
  difficulty: "medium",
  type: 'multiple',
  correct: "An electrical charge that accumulates in certain materials in response to mechanical stress. From the Greek 'piezo' - 'to squeeze'.",
  question: "What is piezoelectricty?",
  ans1: "The first electrical effect observed in biological creatures, documented by Italian biologist Vincente Piezo.",
  ans2: "An electrical discharge that occurs when the mineral piezite is heated.",
  ans4: "The amount of electricty needed to safely cook a 14-inch classic-crust pizza, or 'piezo' in Urdu.",
  answerTxt: "A material is called piezoelectric (pz) if it accumulates an electric charge when a mechanical "
  + "stress is applied (i.e. pinching, pushing, bending, twisting, etc). The cool thing is that the opposite "
  + "is also true - the application of an electric current will cause mechanical deformation. This is actually "
  + "how simple electric buzzers work! A rapidly pulsing current is passed through a thin pz strip or plate "
  + "causing the pz material to rapidly flex. These quick vibrations induce other vibrations in the surrounding "
  + "air - which we then hear as a buzz! The pitch can be changed by altering the length of the current's pulse "
  + "and by increasing or decreasing the current strength!",

  ans3: "A parrot",
  answerTxt: "No one knows for sure, but the first question to ask is if you're dealing with an African "
  + "or European swallow. Regardless of species, one must always remember that the coconut must have a "
  + "peeling husk so that the swallow might get a good grip."

  question: "Which of the following is a non-Newtonian liquid?",
  ans1: "Molten gold",
  ans3: "Salt water",
  ans4: "Bourbon",
  answerTxt: "Ketchup is a Non-Newtonian Liquid (NNL). This means that it behaves like a liquid - except when "
  + "force is sharply applied. Then it behaves like a solid! Another example of a common NNL is corn starch "
  + "in water: you have probably seen this as a type of silly putty. If you run and hit your feet fast enough "
  + "you can actually *run* on NNLs as the material under your feet briefly becomes solid!"

  +"atmospheric pressure?",
  ans2: "Astatine",
  ans3: "Titanium",
  ans4: "Uranium",
  answerTxt: "Tungsten has the highest melting point of any naturally occuring element, melting at a "
  + "blistering 3,422 C (6,191 F). Compare that to Iron (1,538 C/ 2,800 F), and Titanium (1,668 C/ 3,034 F)! "
  + "Tungsten's high melting point has to do with the arrangement of electrons in its d-shell orbitals - "
  + "they're half filled which is an exceptionally stable state to be in. More stability = harder to change."

  question: "Which of these animals can hit thin bulletproof glass hard enough to shatter it?",
  ans1: "Pistol shrimp",
  ans2: "Shard-nose viper",
  ans4: "Snapping turtle",
  answerTxt: "Mantis shrimp have the quickest punch on the planet. The genus has split into two "
  + "broad categories: 1) Spearers, with barbed and pointed arms and 2) Smashers, with club-like "
  + "arms formed via biomineralization. Both types of shrimp hit HARD. Their 'fists' accelerate "
  + "at 102 *thousand* meters per second-squared (228 thousand miles per second-squared). This "
  + "means their 'fists' move at 51mph from a dead standstill..... ouch."

  + "Denali is the tallest mountain in North America at 20, 310', Mount Everest is the "
  + "tallest mountain measured from sea-level on Earth at 29, 029', Mauba Kea is the tallest "
  + "mountain on Earth if measured from its base on the Pacific floor at 33,476', but Olympus "

  ans2: "Any material whose electrical resistance is less than a saturated saltwater solution at 20C",
  ans4: "A metal whose electrical conductivity is less than that of pure copper",
  answerTxt: "A superconductor is a material that has two incredibly useful properties: they have zero "
  + "electrical resistance and they expel magnetic fields. The first property is invaluable for lowering "
  + "energy consumption in electronics (amongst other things) and the second allows magnetic objects to "
  + "levitate."

  + "acceleration and deceleration on the human body. He was heavily involved in personally field testing "
  + "equipment that led to the creation of safe ejection seats and oxygen systems in aircraft. He was "
  + "subjected to over 41.8 Gs on the last test run he did on the Sonic Wind test-sled. He survived because the G-load was applied for only a second or less. Sonic Wind reached 632 miles an "
  + "hour in 5 seconds on that run before the brakes were applied. Funnily enough,  braking generated the greatest forces on his body - "
